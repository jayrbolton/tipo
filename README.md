# tipo

This is a work-in-progress that intends to add a type system to plain JS programs without touching the language itself, using type inference. Explicit type expressions can be added into specially-demarcated comments. It is intended to help check program correctness, increase maintainability, and generate documentation. It is strictly an add-on static analyzer (no need to transpile anything or modify the language itself).
