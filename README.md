# tipo

> Work in progress / experimental

Tipo (tee-poe) is a javascript type checker with an emphasis on type inference, simplicity, and hackability. It does not change or extend the language at all and does not affect the runtime of your program.

### type inference

Run it on your program like a linter to see if it finds type errors:

```js
example
```

### custom types

Custom types are just javascript strings, objects, and arrays. Custom types are simply metadata about your program and helps the type checker to be more specific. This program runs *before* the type checker and affects the type checker's bindings.

```js
example
```
